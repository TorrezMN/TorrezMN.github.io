# Fake Server 
---

In an attempt to understand a little more and to challenge myself, I thought
about the possibility of writing a **web server completely from scratch**.

## The Problem 
---

The challenge in this case, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, is to build
a web server. In order to avoid doing something "repeated", I will try to
complicate the challenge by proposing some entry requirements.

* It happens that in the development stages of any project, it is necessary to
  have test data, and in many cases, it is an unnecessary complexity to try to
  provide oneself with that test data.

* The server must have some endpoints that return JSON objects with data.
    - The quantity of data per object must be configurable.

* The server must be able to perform recurring verification tasks in web
  projects, for example, verifying email addresses.

## Previous Considerations

For this case, the language to be used will be **Python** because of its
characteristics that we all already know and because it is the one I use the
most.

## Basic Design

Lo primero que tenemos que hacer es parar un poquito y PENSAR que estamos haciendo.
