# Retrieving and Storing CodePen Data with Python

In this blog post, we'll discuss how to retrieve and save data from CodePen
using Python. We will use the `requests` library to fetch data from the CodePen
RSS feed, convert it to JSON format using an API service, and then save it to a
file. This approach is useful for archiving your CodePen projects or analyzing
your work over time.

#### Problem

Managing and analyzing CodePen projects can be cumbersome, especially if you
have numerous pens. Manually collecting and storing data about these pens can
be time-consuming. Automating this process not only saves time but also ensures
that you have a structured and accessible record of your work.

#### Idea / Proposed Solution

To address this issue, we propose a Python script that fetches data from
CodePen's RSS feed, converts it into JSON format using an external API, and
saves it into a JSON file. This script will streamline the data retrieval
process and make it easy to archive or analyze your CodePen projects.

#### Stack

- **Python**: The programming language used for scripting.
- **requests**: A Python library for making HTTP requests.
- **json**: A Python library for handling JSON data.
- **RSS to JSON API**: An external service to convert RSS feeds to JSON format.

#### Functionalities

1. **Fetch Data from RSS Feed**: Retrieve CodePen data from the RSS feed URL.
2. **Convert RSS to JSON**: Use an API service to convert RSS feed data to JSON format.
3. **Save Data to JSON File**: Store the converted JSON data into a file for future use.

#### Code / Explanation of Code

Here's the complete code with comments for better understanding:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Author: Torrez, Milton N.

import requests
import json

# Define the URL for the CodePen RSS feed
penRss = "https://codepen.io/torrezmn/public/feed/"

# Define the URL for the RSS to JSON API with the CodePen RSS feed URL
rss2jsonApi = "https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=" + penRss

# Send a GET request to the RSS to JSON API
req = requests.get(rss2jsonApi)

# Load the JSON response from the API
data = json.loads(req.text)

# Save the JSON data to a file named "codepens.json"
with open("codepens.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    # Dump the data into the JSON file with readable formatting
    json.dump(data, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Imports**: Import the necessary `requests` and `json` libraries.
   
2. **Define URLs**: Set the `penRss` variable to the CodePen RSS feed URL and
   construct the `rss2jsonApi` URL to convert the RSS feed into JSON format
   using the RSS to JSON API.

3. **Send Request**: Use `requests.get()` to fetch data from the RSS to JSON
   API.

4. **Parse JSON**: Convert the response text into a Python dictionary using
   `json.loads()`.

5. **Save Data**: Write the JSON data to a file named `codepens.json`. This
   file is encoded in UTF-8 and formatted with an indentation of 4 spaces for
   better readability.

#### Conclusions

Automating the process of retrieving and storing CodePen data using Python
provides a convenient way to manage and archive your projects. By leveraging
the `requests` library for HTTP requests and the `json` library for data
handling, you can efficiently collect and save information about your CodePen
pens.

#### Future Work

1. **Error Handling**: Add error handling to manage potential issues, such as failed requests or invalid responses.
2. **Data Processing**: Enhance the script to perform basic analysis or filtering of the retrieved data.
3. **User Input**: Allow users to specify different CodePen RSS feed URLs or additional parameters.
4. **Automation**: Schedule the script to run periodically to keep the data updated.
5. **Integration**: Integrate with other tools or services for further data processing or visualization.

By building on this basic script, you can create a more comprehensive tool for
managing and analyzing your CodePen projects, making it easier to track and
understand your work over time.
