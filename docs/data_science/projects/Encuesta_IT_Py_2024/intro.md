   by the staff of [Proyectos
   Beta](https://proyectosbeta.net/2024/06/resultados-de-la-encuesta-sobre-developers-en-paraguay-2024/).
   They were very gentle to put on public availability the data collected on
   the survey.

2. **Limitations of the dataset**: The data contained in the dataset its limited

     - With this dataset its not posible to make an asumption of the
       *"representativity"* of the respondents in the survey in comparation with
       the poblation of IT personel in Paraguay.
     - The dataset only has 394 answers.    
     - Even with the considerations set out in the previous points. In some
       cases it *is not posible to make a "real" asumption on some topics*
       becaus its used "range of values" istead of "integer values".
     - In some of the questions asked and optional aswers. There is
       *"cross-domain questions/answers"*.[^1]
[^1]:   The question asks for: "Favorite backend framework" and offers a
programming language as answer option.
     - Some questions are mising some clarity in the formulation.
     - In some cases it is not postible to make an asumption or *determine the
       "temporality"* of the expected answer or question formulated. [^2]   
[^2]: ej. "Modalidad de trabajao."

   by the "*Google Forms*" platform. This platform allows users to:

      interpretation. 

    - To add extra contex to the results in some cases *"Chat GPT" was used*.
      This tool was used to retreive information about "latin america" over
      diferent topics related to the survey. As pointed in the previous
      paragraph, when "Chat GPT" information its presented. This information is "marked" to
      indicate clearly the origin of it.
