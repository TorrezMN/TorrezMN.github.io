## 10 Basic Topics on Django REST Framework (DRF)

Views and Serializers: Building views for handling API requests and using serializers to convert model data to JSON and vice versa.

Authentication and Permissions: Implementing different authentication methods (e.g., token-based) and controlling access to specific resources using permissions.

Filters and Paginations: Allowing users to filter and paginate through large datasets using query parameters.

Relationships and Hypermedia: Defining relationships between models and generating hypermedia links for navigation within the API.

Testing and Documentation: Writing unit and integration tests for your API endpoints and generating API documentation with tools like Swagger.

Mixins and Generic Views: Utilizing built-in mixins and generic views to streamline common tasks like common API patterns.

Class-based Views: Leveraging the advantages of class-based views for better organization and separation of concerns.

API Throttling and Caching: Limiting API requests and implementing caching mechanisms for performance optimization.

Signals and Custom Permissions: Extending DRF functionalities with signals and creating custom permission classes for granular control.

ViewSet and Router: Simplifying API development with ViewSets and using the router to automatically generate URLs.


## 10 Advanced Topics on Django REST Framework

Custom Authentication and Permissions: Implementing unique authentication methods beyond DRF's built-in options and creating complex permission logic.

API Versioning and Rate Limiting: Handling different API versions simultaneously and setting advanced rate limits for specific users or actions.

Third-Party Integrations: Integrating with external services like social media platforms or payment gateways.

Advanced Serialization Techniques: Optimizing serializer performance, leveraging nested serializers, and customizing field representations.

Custom DRF Extensions: Expanding DRF functionalities by writing custom filters, pagination classes, or renderers.
