# Enhancing Django Models with HTML Rendering Methods for Dynamic Templates

---

#### **Issue**

In many Django projects, developers need to display dynamic HTML content within
templates that is generated by model methods. This is common for rendering
styled text, tooltips, or other HTML-based data that requires custom styling or
interactivity. However, Django’s default behavior of escaping HTML can hinder
the display of such content, often leading to limitations in how models can be
used to generate rich UI elements.

#### **Solution/Idea**

A practical solution to this issue is to define methods within Django model
classes that generate HTML content and use Django's template filters to safely
render this content. By defining methods on your models that return HTML and
using the `|safe` filter in templates, you can seamlessly integrate dynamic
HTML into your pages. This approach maintains the separation of concerns
between model logic and template rendering while allowing rich, interactive UI
components.

For example, if you have a model with a method that generates HTML for
displaying user categories with tooltips, you can call this method in your
templates and ensure that the HTML is rendered correctly.

#### **Pros/Cons**

**Pros:**

- **Separation of Concerns:** Keeps HTML generation logic within the model,
  making templates cleaner and more focused on presentation.
- **Reusability:** Methods on models can be reused across different templates
  or views, reducing code duplication.
- **Flexibility:** Allows dynamic generation of HTML based on model data,
  providing flexibility for complex UI requirements.

**Cons:**

- **Security Risks:** Directly rendering HTML can expose your application to
  XSS vulnerabilities if not handled properly. Ensure that all content is
  sanitized or comes from trusted sources.
- **Performance:** Generating complex HTML in model methods may impact
  performance if not optimized, especially if these methods are called
  frequently.
- **Testing Complexity:** Testing methods that output HTML might require
  additional steps to ensure that the HTML is rendered correctly and securely.

#### **Example**

Here’s an example of a Django model with methods that generate HTML for
rendering user categories with tooltips:

```python
from django.utils.html import format_html
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token
from .managers import UserManager

class User(AbstractUser):
    """User model."""

    username = None
    email = models.EmailField(_("email address"), unique=True)
    date_joined = models.DateTimeField(_("date joined"), auto_now_add=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(_("active"), default=True)
    category = models.IntegerField(
        choices=(
            (1, "Management"),
            (2, "Doctor"),
            (3, "Maintenance"),
        ),
        blank=True,
        null=True,
    )

    USERNAME_FIELD = "email"
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []
    objects = UserManager()

    def get_email_name(self):
        return self.email.split("@")[0]

    def get_user_data(self):
        try:
            token = Token.objects.get(user=self).key
            return {
                "user_id": self.id,
                "user_token": token,
            }
        except Token.DoesNotExist:
            return {
                "user_id": self.id,
                "user_token": None,
            }

    def get_category_label(self):
        levels = {
            1: format_html(
                "<span data-toggle='tooltip' title='Management' style='padding:3px 5px; border-radius:4px; color: whitesmoke; background: red; font-weight: bold;'>Management</span>"
            ),
            2: format_html(
                "<span data-toggle='tooltip' title='Doctor' style='padding:5px 5px; border-radius:4px; color: whitesmoke; background: orange; font-weight: bold;'>Doctor</span>"
            ),
            3: format_html(
                "<span data-toggle='tooltip' title='Maintenance' style='padding:5px 5px; border-radius:4px; color: whitesmoke; background: green; font-weight: bold;'>Maintenance</span>"
            ),
        }
        return levels.get(self.category, format_html(
            "<span data-toggle='tooltip' title='Unknown' style='padding:5px 5px; border-radius:4px; color: whitesmoke; background: gray; font-weight: bold;'>Unknown</span>"
        ))
```

#### **How to Use**

1. **Define Methods**: Add methods to your Django model that return HTML
   strings using Django's `format_html` to ensure safety.
2. **Render in Templates**: Use these methods in your Django templates and
   apply the `|safe` filter to render the HTML correctly:
   
```html
<div>
    {{ user.get_category_label|safe }}
</div>
```

3. **Include Required Libraries**: Ensure that any JavaScript libraries needed
   for features like tooltips (e.g., Bootstrap) are included in your template
       or base layout.

#### **Future**

In future iterations, you might explore more advanced features such as:

- **Dynamic JavaScript Integration**: Enhance interactivity with JavaScript
  dynamically loaded or updated based on model data.
- **Improved Security Measures**: Implement robust content sanitization to
  mitigate potential security risks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Cache frequently used HTML content to improve
  performance and reduce load times.

#### **Conclusion**

Integrating HTML rendering methods into Django models offers a powerful way to
enhance your application's UI with dynamic, rich content. By leveraging this
approach, you maintain clean and manageable templates while providing a
flexible, interactive user experience. However, it is essential to be mindful
of security implications and performance considerations to ensure a robust and
secure application.
